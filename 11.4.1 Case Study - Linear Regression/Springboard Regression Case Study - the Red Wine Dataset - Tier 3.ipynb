    "Welcome to the Springboard Regression case study! Please note: this is ***Tier 3*** of the case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study was designed for you to **use Python to apply the knowledge you've acquired in reading *The Art of Statistics* (hereinafter *AoS*) by Professor Spiegelhalter**. Specifically, the case study will get you doing regression analysis; a method discussed in Chapter 5 on p.121. It might be useful to have the book open at that page when doing the case study to remind you of what it is we're up to (but bear in mind that other statistical concepts, such as training and testing, will be applied, so you might have to glance at other chapters too).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to ***use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible***. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll try a *univariate* analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a *multivariate* one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and we'll iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the notebook. The main thing is for you to see how regression analysis looks in Python and jupyter, and to get some practice implementing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this case study, **questions** will be asked in the markdown cells. Try to **answer these yourself in a simple text file** when they come up. Most of the time, the answers will become clear as you progress through the notebook. Some of the answers may require a little research with Google and other basic resources available to every data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we're going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. Make sure it's downloaded and sitting in your working directory. This is a very common dataset for practicing regression analysis and is actually freely available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "You're pretty familiar with the data science pipeline at this point. This project will have the following structure: \n",

    "The outputs of the describe() and value_counts() methods are consistent with our histogram, and since there are just as many values as there are rows in the dataset, we can infer that there are no NAs for the quality variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "But scroll up again to when we called info() on our wine dataset. We could have seen there, already, that the quality variable had int64 as its type. As a result, we had sufficient information, already, to know that the quality variable was not appropriate for regression analysis. Did you figure this out yourself? If so, kudos to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality variable would, however, conduce to proper classification analysis. This is because, while the values for the quality variable are numeric, those numeric discrete values represent *categories*; and the prediction of category-placement is most often best done by classification algorithms. You saw the decision tree output by running a classification algorithm on the Titanic dataset on p.168 of Chapter 6 of *AoS*. For now, we'll continue with our regression analysis, and continue our search for a suitable dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since the rest of the variables of our wine dataset are continuous, we could — in theory — pick any of them. But that does not mean that are all equally sutiable choices. What counts as a suitable dependent variable for regression analysis is determined not just by *intrinsic* features of the dataset (such as data types, number of NAs etc) but by *extrinsic* features, such as, simply, which variables are the most interesting or useful to predict, given our aims and values in the context we're in. Almost always, we can only determine which variables are sensible choices for dependent variables with some **domain knowledge**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of you might be wine buffs, but one very important and interesting quality in wine is [acidity](https://waterhouse.ucdavis.edu/whats-in-wine/fixed-acidity). As the Waterhouse Lab at the University of California explains, 'acids impart the sourness or tartness that is a fundamental feature in wine taste.  Wines lacking in acid are \"flat.\" Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity which affects taste and pH which affects  color, stability to oxidation, and consequantly the overall lifespan of a wine.'\n",
    "\n",
    "If we cannot predict quality, then it seems like **fixed acidity** might be a great option for a dependent variable. Let's go for that."

    "We can call the .corr() method on our wine data to look at all the correlations between our variables. As the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) shows, the default correlation coefficient is the Pearson correlation coefficient (p.58 and p.396 of the *AoS*); but other coefficients can be plugged in as parameters. Remember, the Pearson correlation coefficient shows us how close to a straight line the data-points fall, and is a number between -1 and 1. "
